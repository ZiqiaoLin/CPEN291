Last but not least, I am going to introduce the voice control
functionality. The hardware module of the voice control functionality
is composed of a Raspberry Pi,an Arduino, a webcam and a speaker.
And the software module contains Arduino code, Python code ,and the 
Alexa Voice Service of Amazon. The voice control functionality makes our system
easier to use and more user-friendly. For example, you can directly 
ask the pi ''Alexa, ask computer to turn on the light", to turn on the 
light, "open the door" to open the door and so on; Besides, if u want to know
the temperature, humidity, light level and other data at ur home , u can directly
ask alexa,
or you can tell it to open Victoria Security data page to view the 
data on our website.  Also, u can open your gmail, facebook, 
or any other website with an url using ur voice. You need to add the words "ask computer", 
since thats the activation words of our customised function on Alexa server.

In addtion to our own functions for home automation, you can also use a 
lot of built in functions of Alexa, such as asking Alexa to live stream news 
or play music.
